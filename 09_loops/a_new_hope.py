# Use nested for loops to find four positive integers whose sum is 45, and such that
      the first plus 2, the second minus 2, the third multiplied by 2, and the fourth divided by 2 are all equal 
# Please note that these four numbers are integers, and not necessarily just digits 
# In this problem, we are no longer finding a single four-digit number;
      we are finding four separate numbers 
# However, since we are trying to generate all possible combinations, the procedure should be the same 
# The following mathematical statements are also true about these numbers:

      A + 2 = B - 2 = C ร 2 = D รท 2

      and
      A + B + C + D = 45

      Output:
      A B C D
