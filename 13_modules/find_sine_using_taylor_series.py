# You need to find the sin of an angle (degrees) without using the sin() function 
# This could be cool to know if you run into a problem but don't have a calculator 
# You can only user the four basic operatiors (+, -, /, *) 
# One way is to take a certain amount of terms from the Taylor series for sine

      sin x = x - x3/3! + x5/5! - x7/7! + 
# where x is in radians 
# Take these four terms only 
# Convert the input in degrees to radians, by using this formula:
      x = (x / 180 
# 0) * pi
