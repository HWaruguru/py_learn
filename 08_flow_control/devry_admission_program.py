# Write a program that reads user input for a student's grade point average and SAT exam score, and uses these values to decide whether the student is admitted to the university. A GPA below 1.8 will cause the student to be rejected; and a SAT score below 900 will also cause a rejection. Otherwise the student is accepted.
