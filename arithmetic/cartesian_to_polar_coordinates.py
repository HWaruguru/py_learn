# Write a program which accepts Cartesian coordinates x and y, and prints its Polar coordinates form i 
# e 
# r and Theta (degrees only) 
# Round off r and Theta to 2 decimal places 
# Program should work for all possible values of x and y (i 
# e, +ve and -ve) 
# Info 
# about the procedure to convert Cartesian to Polar co-ordinates could be found here
